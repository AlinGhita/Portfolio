## About me

My name is Alin Ghita. I have recently embarked on a career change journey in order to become a Software Tester. This career path has interested me for quite a while, so I am excited to be given a chance to prove my skills. I believe that high quality is the bestselling point of services and products. Thanks to my previous experience I have highly developed interpersonal skills and empathy, which help me see the bigger picture and function well within a team. My international experience has also equipped me with valuable tools, such as open-mindedness and adaptability. In this portfolio I would like to share my testing knowledge and exhibit my technical skills, which I gained during the testing course I have completed and through self-learning. I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field. This is why I am now looking for a junior position in software testing.
